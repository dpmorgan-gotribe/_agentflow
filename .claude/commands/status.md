description: Check current development phase, progress, and context
---

Check the current development status:

1. Read `.meta/current-phase.md` and summarize what phase we're in
2. Read `.meta/plans/current-plan.md` and report completed vs pending tasks
3. Run `git log --oneline -5` to show recent commits
4. Check `.meta/lessons/index.md` for any relevant lessons
5. Provide a brief summary: where we are, what's next, any blockers
