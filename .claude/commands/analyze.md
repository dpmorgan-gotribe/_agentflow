# Multi-Perspective Analysis: $ARGUMENTS

## Context Loading

First, understand the context:
- Current phase: Read `.meta/current-phase.md`
- Implementation plan: Reference `.meta/plans/current-plan.md`
- Relevant lessons: Search `.meta/lessons/` for related topics

## Perspective Analysis

I'll analyze this question from multiple expert perspectives:

### 🏗️ Architect Perspective
*Thinking as a senior software architect...*

Consider:
- System design implications
- Scalability concerns
- Component coupling and cohesion
- Consistency with existing architecture
- Long-term maintainability
- Technical debt implications

**Analysis:**
[Architect's view on $ARGUMENTS]

**Recommendation:**
[What the architect would suggest]

---

### 💻 Backend Developer Perspective
*Thinking as an experienced backend developer...*

Consider:
- Implementation complexity
- Performance implications
- Database considerations
- API design
- Error handling
- Existing code patterns

**Analysis:**
[Backend dev's view on $ARGUMENTS]

**Recommendation:**
[What the backend dev would suggest]

---

### 🎨 Frontend Developer Perspective
*Thinking as a frontend developer...*

Consider:
- User experience impact
- State management
- Component design
- Loading states and error handling
- Accessibility
- Cross-platform considerations

**Analysis:**
[Frontend dev's view on $ARGUMENTS]

**Recommendation:**
[What the frontend dev would suggest]

---

### 🧪 Tester Perspective
*Thinking as a QA engineer...*

Consider:
- Testability
- Edge cases
- Integration testing needs
- Regression risk
- Test maintenance burden
- Coverage gaps

**Analysis:**
[Tester's view on $ARGUMENTS]

**Recommendation:**
[What the tester would suggest]

---

### 🔒 Security Perspective
*Thinking as a security engineer...*

Consider:
- Authentication/authorization implications
- Data exposure risks
- Input validation needs
- Audit requirements
- Compliance considerations
- Attack surface changes

**Analysis:**
[Security engineer's view on $ARGUMENTS]

**Recommendation:**
[What the security engineer would suggest]

## Synthesis

### Points of Agreement
[Where perspectives align]

### Points of Tension
[Where perspectives conflict and why]

### Trade-offs
| Option | Pros | Cons | Risk |
|--------|------|------|------|
| A | | | |
| B | | | |

### Recommendation

Based on the multi-perspective analysis:

**Recommended approach:** [Synthesis of best path forward]

**Key considerations:**
1. [Most important factor]
2. [Second most important]
3. [Third most important]

**Risks to monitor:**
- [Risk 1]
- [Risk 2]

**Next steps:**
1. [Immediate action]
2. [Follow-up action]

## Decision Capture

If this is a significant architectural decision, should we capture it as an ADR (Architecture Decision Record)?

If yes, I'll create a file in `docs/decisions/` with:
- Decision title
- Context
- Options considered
- Decision made
- Consequences
